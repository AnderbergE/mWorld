How to run experiments:
Copy the entire example folder to the "build" directory and change the url in your browser according to the path.

Example:
Copy "tweens" to "build".
We now have path "build/tweens" with file "ex.html" in it.

Change url to:
http://localhost:9000/tweens/ex.html
(You need grunt running)
